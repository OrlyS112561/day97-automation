# day97-automation
The program scrapes Bible readings information for the day (book name, chapter, and verse numbers) from a Catholic website. This information is used as the key to access a free Bible API to get the full content of the readings (World English Bible) and is saved in a text file.  This program can be uploaded in Python Anywhere and run daily to get a compilation of the daily Bible readings for the year.
